            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Light Phone: Designed for Disconnecting</h1><p>Phone addiction is real-as evidenced by a quick glance down the street, in the subway, even at the dinner table-and is one of the reasons why Apple developed a watch: so we would look at our screens less and be present more. For some, however, a smartwatch isn't enough-it still leaves room for fiddling and distraction.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/83d0f5ce299ad3d7f079d449896c88dcc2ec48b8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Smith then met mobile developer Aaron Sutula in a coffee seminar held by an espresso machine company. "I took a day off of work to go," remembers Sutula.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f4cab8b5548c02525515410d6e85dd5580051ec9.jpg"></article>]]></description>
